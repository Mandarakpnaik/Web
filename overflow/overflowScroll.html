        Sandalwood is a fragrant, fine-grained aromatic wood from trees in the genus Santalum, 
        most notably Santalum album. The wood and its essential oil are highly valued for use in perfumery,
         religious ceremonies, traditional medicine, and cosmetics, due to their distinctive woody scent and medicinal properties.
         It is a slow-growing tree that requires specific conditions to grow and is often cultivated for its heartwood, which can be harvested after 15 to 20 years. </div>
