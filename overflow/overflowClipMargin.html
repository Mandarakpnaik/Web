        The term "sandalwood industry" is most commonly used to refer to the Kannada film industry, based in Karnataka, India, which is known for its sandalwood trees. 
        The name is an adaptation of "Hollywood" and is also known as "Chandanavana". It is not to be confused with the actual timber industry for sandalwood trees,
         which are a valuable natural resource.Global annual demand significantly outstrips supply from natural sources, leading to high market prices and rapid price increases. 
         The global sandalwood market is projected to grow,with the oil segment alone expected to reach significant value in the coming years. </div>
